By working together with cuGraph, cuGraph-Ops, cuGraph-DGL, cuGraph-PyG, and upstream DGL and PyG, it will be easy to build GNN applications.</p> <p>WholeGraph GitHub Repo</p>"},{"location":"glossary/#worker","title":"Worker","text":""},{"location":"references/","title":"TigerGraph CuGraph Integration References","text":"<p>CuGraph GitHub Repo</p>"}]}
