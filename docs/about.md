# About the TigerGraph NVIDIA Partnership

TigerGraph has a long history of working with graph evangilists within NVIDIA.
Although GPUs were not designed to do graph analytics, by using 
[sparse matrix](glossary.md#sparse-matrix) represnetations we can use GPUs to accelerate some graph algorithms.

NVIDIA GPUs also offer the ability to train [Graph Neural Networks](glossary.md/#graph-neural-network-gnn)
to perform tasks such as link prediction, recommendation and anomolyy detection.

This guide is designed for developers that are building solutions that integrate NVIDIA hardware into TigerGraph.
